## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Gemini Chatbot on your local machine and for deployment.

### Step 1: Get Your Google Gemini API Key

To use this chatbot, you need an API key from Google AI Studio. This key authenticates your requests to the Gemini model.

1.  **Go to Google AI Studio:** Open your web browser and navigate to <https://aistudio.google.com/>.

2.  **Sign In:** Sign in with your Google account.

3.  **Create API Key:**

    * Once you're in Google AI Studio, look for the **"Get API Key"** or **"Get API Key in a new project"** button (or similar wording) in the sidebar or on the main page.

    * Click it to generate your API key.

    * **Important:** Copy this API key immediately! You won't be able to see it again after you close the window. Keep it secure and do not share it publicly.

    (If you already have an API key, you can find it under "API keys" in the left sidebar.)
